This is a repository containing classwork from SNHU.

1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    The gaming room client is a company that hosts games for a wide user-base. They requested that their game be made accessible across multiple platforms. Specifically IOS, Android, Windows, MacOS, etc. The game would need to be able to service multiple players all in sync and manage user accounts and active games.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    I did very well researching all the requirements of creating a multiplatform application, such as understanding RAM, storage, HTTP requests, server-side, and client side.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    Creating a document like this is helpful in that you plan things from the ground up, makes you think of things in a software and hardware perspective which is important when creating a performant server/application.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    One piece of the software design document I would revise is the evaluation and the recommendation sections. I would have been more thorough in my research and in my articulation of these sections. I could have added more about CDN's or Content Delivery Networks which would have been a great way to reduce latency to the users.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    The way I interpreted the users needs was first by examining the functionality of the software and assessing how the software is going to be using resources. I then decided what the best method of memory management from a software perspective. Things like how important resources will be stored in memory and accessed when the application is running and how the application will store long term data. I then roughly estimated the required resources to implement that software. This is crucial to creating a performant application that meets the clients needs as the goal of this design document is to win the client.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? 
    I first consider the clients requirements and the desired functionality of the application. I then did some research into some ways to implement the desired functionality and consider the hardware requirements as well as the software requirements and system architecture as well. I come up with the best and most realistic choices when considering the cost, security and ease of use. In the future I would also take time to make UML diagrams to visualize the design of the hardware and software. This would also be subject to change as an agile approach is the best method for designing software.
